1) Setup a K8s cluster (k3s is preferred)
2) Install and setup KubeArmor in the cluster by using this [guide](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/blob/main/getting-started/deployment_guide.md) 
3) Clone this repo and build it as mentioned in the README.md 
4) go and edit the grafana.yaml in the grafana-es/deploy directory by specifying the correct plugin path for the 3 path for example 
(path: /home/hari/opensource/grafana_Kubearmor/accuknox-kubearmorplugin-datasource/dist) change this path to correct path to the dist 
for example `path/to/the/plugin/dist` similarly change others as well.
5) Clone the [repo](https://github.com/harisudarsan1/kubearmor-dashboards) and run `kubectl apply -f grafana-es/deploy/`
6) Now open grafana by `kubectl port-forward deploy/grafana -n kubearmor 3000:3000` and open localhost:3000.
7) go to datasources and add `http://elasticsearch:9200` as url and select elasticsearch in the backend field and click test.
8) Now run `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/main/examples/wordpress-mysql/wordpress-mysql-deployment.yaml` to create some deployments monitored 
by Kubermor
9) Do some kubectl exec into these pods and go to grafana create a new dashboard and select the KubeArmor Datasource
you should be able to view the Nodegraph generated from ES logs by Kubermor.
